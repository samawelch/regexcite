# regexcite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a toy package that is being uploaded while I work through [Chapter 1]
(https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html#use_mit_license) of the textbook R Packages (2nd ed.).

## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("samawelch/regexcite")
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(regexcite)
## basic example code
str_split_one(string = "a, b, c", pattern = ", ", n = Inf) # n constraints number of returned elements
```
